Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Project Description
This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and alert the user of potential security breaches. The system can detect various types of attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS), probing, and unauthorized access, leveraging machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.
Anomaly Detection: Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, SVM, or neural networks) to detect anomalies.
Alert System: Provides real-time alerts via a web interface or email notifications.
Scalability: Designed to handle high-volume network traffic and scale according to network size.
Logs and Reports: Keeps detailed logs of detected attacks and provides downloadable reports.
Customizable Detection Rules: Users can add their own detection rules based on their specific security needs.
Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries/Frameworks:
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
numpy, pandas for data processing
Flask for web interface (optional)
Database: SQLite/MySQL for storing logs
Visualization: matplotlib or seaborn for plotting graphs of network activity
Deployment: Docker for containerized deployment

Prerequisites
Before running the IDS system, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+
pip (Python package manager)
scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, Flask, matplotlib (use requirements.txt for easy installation)
Network packet capture tools such as tcpdump or Wireshark
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/IDS.git
cd IDS
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the system: Edit the config.py file to specify database credentials, alert preferences (email, SMS), and machine learning parameters.

Run the IDS:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
Alternatively, if using a web-based interface:

bash
Copy code
flask run
View Network Activity: Access the web interface by navigating to http://localhost:5000 to view the real-time monitoring dashboard.

Usage
The system will automatically begin monitoring network traffic once started.
Detected intrusions will trigger an alert and be logged in the system.
You can configure custom rules by modifying the rules.json file.
Logs and reports are accessible through the web interface or as plain-text files.
Machine Learning Models
The IDS supports multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks (DNN)
The default model is a decision tree trained on the KDD Cup 99 dataset. You can switch models in the config.py file or retrain them using your dataset by running:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py --dataset your_dataset.csv


Future Enhancements
Integration with external SIEM systems for enterprise-level logging.
More advanced attack detection algorithms using deep learning.
Support for distributed intrusion detection using multiple nodes.
